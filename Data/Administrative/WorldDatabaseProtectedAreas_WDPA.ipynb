    "### Metadata\n",
    "The WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The compilation and management of the WDPA is carried out by UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. There are monthly updates of the data which are made available online through the ProtectedPlanet website where the data is both viewable and downloadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and information on the world's protected areas compiled in the WDPA are used for reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity on progress towards reaching the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (particularly Target 11), to the UN to track progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, to some of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) core indicators, and other international assessments and reports including the Global Biodiversity Outlook, as well as for the publication of the United Nations List of Protected Areas. Every two years, UNEP-WCMC releases the Protected Planet Report on the status of the world's protected areas and recommendations on how to meet international goals and targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many platforms are incorporating the WDPA to provide integrated information to diverse users, including businesses and governments, in a range of sectors including mining, oil and gas, and finance. For example, the WDPA is included in the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, an innovative decision support tool that gives users easy access to up-to-date information that allows them to identify biodiversity risks and opportunities within a project boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reach of the WDPA is further enhanced in services developed by other parties, such as the Global Forest Watch and the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, which provide decision makers with access to monitoring and alert systems that allow whole landscapes to be managed better. Together, these applications of the WDPA demonstrate the growing value and significance of the Protected Planet initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the WDPA please read through the [User Manual](http://wcmc.io/WDPA_Manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "File sizes are large due to detail and resultion of the vectors. Gaps and overlaps are evident and can be fixed with code below. Processing time is lengthy. Please note, only gaps smaller than 0.5ha will be fixed as gaps larger than this could be valid. Gaps smaller than 0.5ha could also be valid but are removed in this instance for improved drawing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. View code below - originally processed in ArcGIS but can be converted to open source QGIS or GDAL (or others)."
