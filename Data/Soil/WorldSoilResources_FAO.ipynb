    "## Title: World Soil Resources Base Map FAO 2014\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The World Resource Base Map of World Soil Resources is available at 1:25 000 000 scale. This is the most general digital map of the World's soils, now using the international standard soil classification WRB. Available as a graphic or digital coverage.\n",
    "#Soil Type underpins the processes for estimating the changes in SOC as a result of changes to land use. Soil Type, when used in conjunction with climate data, is used for determining the IPCC Tier 1 SOC reference levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLINT\n",
    "This dataset has been pre-processed/checked and is suitable for use in FLINT. Please adhere to individual dataset licence conditions and citations. Processed data can be accessed here: https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/\n",

    "### Processing\n",
    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. View code below - originally processed in ArcGIS but can be converted to open source QGIS or GDAL (or others)."
